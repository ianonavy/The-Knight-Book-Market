    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>This site was made to help students who like to save money when purchasing their textbooks. The official online store claims to save students money by selling used books. However, these books are often still overpriced or out of stock and there's no guarantee that the book is in good condition.</p>
     <p>The Knight Book Market provides a place for students to easily buy and sell used textbooks. Here, students can often purchase books at a lower prices than at the official bookstore. Since the students are buying books directly from their peers, no money is lost to the corporate middle man.</p>
     <h2>Why the Knight Book Market?</h2>
         <h3>Buyers</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>You save lots and lots of money.</li>
            <li>You don't have to pay (or wait) for shipping.</li>
            <li>You can check out the book's condition before actually buying it whereas the official bookstore will ship it randomly.</li>
            <li>You get your books early so you can start your summer assignments in advance. :P</li>
            <li>There's no rush. You have all summer to get your books, and whatever you can't find here can still be bought at the official bookstore.</li>
            <li>There's no tax (unless your seller is a jerk).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sellers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Students will buy your books for more than the official buy back program.</li>
            <li>You don't have to carry all of your books at once to school on book buy back day. You can make the exchange with your book's purchaser whenever you like.</li>
            <li>You get your money immediately. No waiting for a check in the mail.</li>
            <li>You get all of the money. None of it goes to this site or anyone else (unless you want to be awesome and <a href="/donate/">make a donation</a>).</li>

         </ul>
    <h2>A few words of warning...</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Buying a book from a friend through here may get you the wrong version. Although this site is for your convenience, please do your research and make sure that you have the right version online.</li>
            <li>These purchases are probably not tax deductible. If anyone asks, you "gave" them a book, and they "gave" you money.</li>
            <li>You can't buy new books for cheapy here. If you want that, go to Amazon, eBay or something.</li>
        </ul>
